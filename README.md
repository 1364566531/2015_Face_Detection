# Cascade CNNs for Face Detection
The main idea is from 2015 CVPR Cascade CNNs for Face Detection.(L.Hao,Z.Lin etc.)

MatconvNet has been used in this code.(More reference you can find at last.)The trainning data which I used is aflw database(you can download from database website for free after application).So I don't conclude data in this repos.

This branch only include the training part. The test part will base on fddb database. It will be upload soon.
**MatConvNet** is a MATLAB toolbox implementing *Convolutional Neural
Networks* (CNNs) for computer vision applications. It is simple,
efficient, and can run and learn state-of-the-art CNNs. Several
example CNNs are included to classify and encode images. Please visit
the [homepage](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet) to know more.
